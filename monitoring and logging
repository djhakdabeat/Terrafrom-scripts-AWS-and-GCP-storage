## Enable Monitoring & Logging
AWS
Enable CloudTrail for API activity tracking.
Turn on GuardDuty for threat detection.
Use AWS Config for compliance assessments.
Set up CloudWatch Logs and Alarms for real-time monitoring.
Resources:

CloudTrail Setup
GuardDuty Setup
AWS Config
CloudWatch Alarms
GCP
Enable Cloud Audit Logs.
Set up Security Command Center.
Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring.

## Configure Notifications & Alerts:

AWS SNS: for email/SMS notifications
GCP Pub/Sub + Cloud Functions: for event-driven alerts
Setup Guide:

Create SNS topics/subscriptions in AWS.
Create Pub/Sub topics in GCP.
Integrate with CloudWatch Alarms or audit logs to trigger notifications.
Example:

Set an alarm for suspicious activity; on trigger, send email or invoke Lambda/Cloud Function to initiate auto-remediation.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Automated Incident Response:

Use AWS Lambda and GCP Cloud Functions to automate responses:
Revert misconfigurations.
Disable compromised accounts.
Send alerts to security teams.
Example Lambda Function:

import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    bucket_name = "my-secure-data-lake"
    # Revert bucket policy if needed
    with open('policy.json', 'r') as f:
        good_policy = f.read()
    s3.put_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket_name, Policy=good_policy)
    print("Reverted to compliant policy.")

----------------------------------------------------------------

** Trigger these functions via CloudWatch Events or audit log alerts.

4. Continuous Security & Vulnerability Scanning
Integrate Checkov and Terraform Validator into your CI/CD pipeline for policy enforcement.
Use AWS Inspector and GCP Security Scanner for runtime vulnerability scans.

5. Regular Security Audits & Policy Updates
Schedule periodic reviews of IAM policies, resource configurations, and security logs.
Keep your infrastructure up-to-date with latest patches and best practices.
